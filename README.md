# MyFloodApp

**MyFloodApp** is a Jupyter Notebook-based application designed to analyze, simulate, and visualize flood-related data. This application aims to assist researchers, urban planners, and policymakers in understanding flood patterns and making data-driven decisions to mitigate flood risks.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Analyze historical flood data and identify patterns or trends.
- **Simulation**: Run flood simulations to predict potential flooding scenarios.
- **Visualization**: Visualize flood data on interactive plots and maps.
- **Python Integration**: Leverage Python libraries for machine learning, data processing, and analysis.

## Tech Stack

The project is developed using:

- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive computing and visualization.
- **Python**: Supporting libraries for data analysis and processing.
